# Darkweather

## Weather application


A weather app that was developed on the premise of a personal challenge to turn a weather API into a working weather application in less than a week.  Gathers data from the DarkSky API to get current weather, hourly weather, weekly forecast, and a weather time machine for past and future weather. 

Working app found at <http://darkweatherprototype.herokuapp.com>
